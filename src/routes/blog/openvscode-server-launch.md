At Gitpod our focus has always been to remove all friction from the developer experience to empower developers to be always ready-to-code. Over the last couple of months we have come a long way and today are excited to announce a $13m funding round led by General Catalyst, a fully revamped visual & brand identity as well as several product milestones aimed at defining a new product category in modern software development.
